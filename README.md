I wrote a few scripts to see which numbers cannot be represented by the sum of three squares. 

To read more about the origin of this project, see [this blog post](https://johnlarkin1.github.io/2016/11/19/three-square-theorem.html).

To compile the program, run:
```
g++ -o three_square three_numbers_square.cpp 
```

Thanks so much! I appreciate any feedback.
